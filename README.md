# Christmas-Toy-2024
Animated page of snowflakes falling initially made as a Christmas present to my family that I have since improved. This project aims to use modern web techniques with a responsive design.

# KNOWN ISSUES
There is a  blank space at the bottom of the page in Vanadium on GrapheneOS (unsure of how to fix currently).
